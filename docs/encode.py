"""Encode one channel of raw 48 kHz stereo 16-bit audio as a track for decode.cq.

    encode.py IN.s16 CHANNEL START_S SECONDS CARDS [EXPECT]

CHANNEL is 0 for the left channel or 1 for the right. The track is written to CARDS, one card per line. If EXPECT
is given, the samples the decoder should output are written there, one per line. For each block of 64 samples, the
encoder picks the step size M * 10^K (M from 1 to 9, K from 0 to 3) with the smallest error. It chooses each code
against the decoder's own prediction (twice the previous sample, minus the one before it), and it never lets a
sample go outside 16 bits.
